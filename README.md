# OUR Rescue Ionic App

I created a fully functioning Ionic app that allows it's users to get involved with Operation Underground Railroad (OUR Rescue), a nonprofit devoted to rescuing children from sex trafficking. OUR Rescue has teams that consists of former CIA, Navy SEALs, and Special Ops operatives that go in undercover to rescue and extract children from their traffickers. They work with the local governments to bring justice to the traffickers and recovery and rehabilitation to the survivors. On their website they have a “Join The Fight” page that allows those wishing to get involved the opportunity and resources to contribute to the cause. This is a cause I am extremely passionate about so when I found out that OUR Rescue did not have an app yet I decided to learn Ionic and create an app based about their “Join the Fight” page. This project was done while I was attending DevMountain, a 13 week web development bootcamp, as my first fullstack project. Ionic is not taught as part of the curriculum so I learned it on my own and built the app in the two week time frame we had for our personal projects. The other technologies used were HTML/CSS, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, Gulp, Sass, and
Stripe was incorporated to allow for processing store purchases and donations.
